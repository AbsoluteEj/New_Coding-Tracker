## Takeaways
- Plan before you code
- Always test build or run the code after finishing a feature/implementation

- Knowing the logic flow of the app will help you know what to do next
- Create a working solution first (IMPORTANT!), then refactor after
- Write concise comments more or better, make your code readable as plain English
