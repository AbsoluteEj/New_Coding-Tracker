### New_Coding-Tracker

# Takeaways
- Plan before you code
- Always test build or run the code after finishing a feature
- Simple is best
- Knowing the logic flow of the app will help you know what to do next
- Create a working solution first (IMPORTANT!), then refactor after
- Write comments or better, make your code readable as plain English
- Object-oriented programming is confusing (yet), I need more exposure and experience for pattern recognition
